## UX 
### Project Goals 

The overall objective of this project is to give users information about a pub and restaurant located in Wells, England. This is a history rich pub that used to be an old city jail. 
It is aimed towards both tourists and locals alike, who are looking for something to eat, drink or just have a look at the old building. There are also rooms upstairs offering 
lovely accommodation. This website should be easy to navigate, while aiming to provide users with everything they need to know about this old pub in an easily
navigable manner. With all of this in mind, it should encourage users to go and check out the pub for themselves. 

### User Goals:
* Informative website that serves to provide all needed information about the pub, for example food, drink, opening times and accommdation availability.
* Well placed calls to action which inspire users to get in touch with the pub and continue their experience offline
* Ability to send a message via a contact form for ease of access
* Location map which makes it easy for users to find
* Use the website across all screen sizes, from desktop to mobile. Fully responsive design.

### Design Decisions
* As the pub is quite old and traditional, the design will be influenced by toned down colour schemes and structure. As the pub itself is quite historic, the   

#### Fonts: 
I opted for Libre Baskerville as it is a more traditional font based on older serif styles. This will compliment the ambience of the pub. While the goal of the website is to encourage
web visitors to come into the pub, the history of the pub plays a large role in this. With this in mind, Libre Baskerville does a good job of reinforcing this historic feel. 

### Icons:
Icons will be used to further identify what certain parts of the website do. These should always be relevant, so as to provide a more navigable website and better user experience. The
burger icon will be utilized on mobile and tablet devices, as this is the universal navigation symbol for smaller screens.  

### Colours
The pub itself has a dark coral exterior, while darker colours dominate indoors. This will be replicated in the colour scheme of the website. Again, this will maintain the more traditional
feel. The following color scheme was selected based on this;
* Primary: #a98a90 "Dark Mauve" - This will be the brightest colour shown throughout the website, although it is still quite toned down. It will be shown across section backgrounds and 
in some cases icons. 
* Secondary: #54595F - This is a dark charcoal grey, which compliments the dark mauve. This will be utilized for text headings and also icons in some cases.


###Bugs 
* Nav bar menu not clickable for the toggle icon on smaller screens.
